# Social Media Rights Act
Ensures fundamental privacy and custodianship protections social media platforms must provide.

# Background
This is an open source effort to draft a bill to protect the rights of people who make use of social media. It is an attempt to crowdsource and develop in the open draft legislation that can be brought to Congress and passed in the United States. I'm optimistic that somewhere out there are people who can contribute key concepts as well as people who can translate those concepts into the format and language necessary to count as legislation that can be adopted.

# Fundamental Principles
To be added based on Pull Requests and discussion.

# Details
Each fundamental principle to be elaborated. Is there a template a bill must follow?
